# Education Diamond

Diamond Contract which is called EIP-2535 is the most advanced upgradable smart contracts.
It is multi facet proxy contracts which allow developers to upgrade easily already deploy contracts.

It has lots of valuable articles and turtorials.
This repository provides you lots of resources to study Diamond Contract.
